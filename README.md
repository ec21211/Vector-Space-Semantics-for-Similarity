# Vector-Space-Semantics-for-Similarity
An Eastenders script data document (ie the file training.csv) is going to be used to create a vector representation of the lines said by each character, and then we'll work to improve that representation so each character document is clearly distinguishable from the rest of them. An evaluation of this difference is based on the ability of a basic information retrieval classification algorithm to correctly classify documents from validation and test data (i.e. deciding which character spoke the lines by measuring the similarity of those document vectors to those built in training).
